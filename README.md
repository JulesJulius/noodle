# Feature: Workspace Concept

This branch focuses on building out the Workspace concept for the web app. The Workspace is a dedicated area within the application that allows users to perform specific tasks in a clean, full-screen environment.

## Overview

The Workspace concept is designed to provide users with a focused, immersive environment for their tasks. This branch includes the initial implementation of the Workspace, with basic structure and styling.

## Directory Structure

The new Workspace feature introduces the following structure within the `public` directory:

```plaintext
public/
│
├── workspace/
│   ├── workspace.js
│   ├── workspace.html
│   └── workspace.css
│
├── app.js
├── index.html
├── manifest.json
├── service-worker.js
├── .gitignore
├── README.md
├── server.js
├── ws-server.js
└── styles.css
```

##Files and Their Roles
#workspace.html
This HTML file defines the structure of the Workspace page. It includes a container for the Workspace content.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Workspace</title>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="workspace.css">
    <script src="workspace.js" defer></script>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="workspace">
        <h1>Workspace</h1>
        <p>This is the workspace area.</p>
    </div>
</body>
</html>
```

# workspace.css
## This CSS file provides basic styling for the Workspace page, ensuring it occupies the full screen and prevents scrolling.

```css
body, html {
    margin: 0;
    padding: 0;
    height: 100%;
    width: 100%;
    overflow: hidden;
}

#workspace {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100%;
    background-color: #f0f0f0;
}

h1 {
    font-size: 2em;
}

p {
    font-size: 1.2em;
}
```

# workspace.js
## This JavaScript file initializes the Workspace and contains placeholder code for further development.

```js
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
    console.log('Workspace loaded');
    // Add your JavaScript code for the workspace here
});
```
